                            Namaste I am Chanda Shrestha. I was born and brought up in Kathmandu, Nepal. I went to high school in Dehradhun, India. I
                            moved to the United States in 2008. I finished my college graduating in Accounting in December,
                            2013. I joined the active duty military in 2014 and completed my four years of commitment in
                            Army in February, 2018.

                I am 29 years old. I speak four different languages. I am a universalist and respect every culture and religion. If I were
                to ever have a pet, Iâ€™d like to have a fish.

                I work as a software quality assurance engineer at Bridge360. I am getting used to the civilian life and the SMU Coding Bootcamp
                just has added value to my work. I am looking forward to pursue my career in this field.
